# Opinion Dynamics and Price Formation: Simulating the GME Short Squeeze Event

This is final year project for the Financial Technology program under the Systems Engineering and Engineering Management Department at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. 
We intend to make our codes and report public as a way to contribute to the spirit of open-source and offer what little guidance they may bring to other researchers who are
studying the same topic. 

Python environment: 3.7.8
Packages: numpy

To run the code:
go to main_simulation.py and run it
To change the parameters, go to initialization()
To edit specific model behaviors, go to the corresponding .py files (e.g. combined_simulation_1.py) where you can find the specific mechanisms.


Feel free to contact us for questions.
