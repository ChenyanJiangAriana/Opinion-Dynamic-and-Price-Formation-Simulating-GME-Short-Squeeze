This is final year project for the Financial Technology program under the Systems Engineering and Engineering Management Department at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. 
We intend to make our codes and report public as a way to contribute to the spirit of open-source and offer what little guidance they may bring to other researchers who are
studying the same topic. 

Feel free to contact us for questions.
